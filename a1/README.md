# Assignment 1

game.c

This program reads integers from a binary file and builds a singly linked list with the numbers. The program will then prompt the user for a number and then print a message that  tells the user whether or not the number is in the list. The program will keep prompting for a number until the user decides to quit.


game2.c

This program is the modified version of the game.c program, which instead reads an ascii text file to fill the linked list.
